Python in NeuroImaging
======================


Please provide for every sub-project a brief Description, list of
Features, some nice figure if you have any.  Hopefully eventually we
get enough of tasty materials someone could compose into a flier.

Nipype
~~~~~~
http://nipy.org/nipype

 Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of 
algorithms from different packages (e.g., SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, Camino, AFNI, 
Slicer), eases the design of workflows within and between packages, and 
reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is 
creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development in a 
high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline systems.

Nipype allows you to:

 - easily interact with tools from different software packages
 - combine processing steps from different software packages
 - develop new workflows faster by reusing common steps from old ones
 - process data faster by running it in parallel on many cores/machines
 - make your research easily reproducible
 - share your processing workflows with the community

PyMVPA eases statistical learning analyses (or otherwise called
Multivariate pattern analysis, MVPA) of large datasets, with an accent
on neuroimaging.

Features:

 - Easy I/O to Neuroimaging data (via NiBabel)
 - Variety of machine learning methods (e.g. SVM, SMLR, kNN)
 - Uniform interfaces to other toolkits (e.g. MDP, Shogun, Scikit-learn)
 - Flexible Searchlight-ing
 - Uber-Fast GNB Searchlight-ing
 - Hyperalignment (Haxby et al 2011, Neuron)
